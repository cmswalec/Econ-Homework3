```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(lmtest)
library(stargazer)

HW3Data <- read_csv("HW3Data.csv")
```

1. Create a linear probability model that predicts a respondents's probability of voting 'yes' on the ballot base don their age, income, NEP score, risk reduction offered and the cost of the program to that respondent.

```{r}

HW3Data$income <- factor(HW3Data$income)
HW3Data$age <- factor(HW3Data$age)

HW3Data$age<- relevel(HW3Data$age, ref = "tothirty")
levels(HW3Data$age)

whale_lpm<- glm(vote ~ risk + bid + NEP + income + age, data = HW3Data, family = "binomial")

summary(whale_lpm)



```
logit(odds of yes vote) = -2.088 + 0.0042(risk) - 0.0059(bid) + 0.083(NEP) + 0.059(incomeone_percent) + 0.04(incomepoor) + 0.060(incomerich)+ 0.278(incomevery_rich) + 0.063(agetofifty) - 0.127(agetoforty) - 0.108(agetosixty) + 0.092(agetothirty)

```{r star_gazer, results = 'asis', header = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
stargazer(whale_lpm, 
          type = 'html', 
          title = "Vote for VSR in Santa Barbara")


```

For every unit increase in risk, the log odds of a "yes" vote increases by 0.004.  

```{r}

whale_odds <- function(whale_lpm){
  odds <- exp(whale_lpm)
  prob <- odds / (1 + odds)
  return(prob)
}

whale_odds(coef(whale_lpm))

```
```{r}

predict_prob<- predict.glm(whale_lpm, type = "response", se.fit = TRUE)
predict_prob$fit

fitted<- as.data.frame(predict_prob$fit)

```



2. 

Increase risk reduction 1 unit --> increase probability of "yes" vote by .5
The value of reducing risk is very high



3. Estimate willingness to pay (aka bid) for VSR of 60% 

```{r}



```
